# RoastWear
Project Description:
RoastWear is a web application that combines humor, creativity, and customization into one exciting platform. It enables users to browse and purchase pre-designed T-shirts featuring funny memes or create their own personalized T-shirt designs. The platform also integrates with Tenor, a popular GIF and meme library, to allow users to import trending memes directly into the design tool. Users can add custom text or images and preview their designs in real-time before ordering.
